# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: January 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Setup the environment.

**Thoughts:** The course I'm using recommends using VSCode for my environment as well as downloading the LTS of NodeJS.

### Day 1: January 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built an entirely functional web counter app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScrpit. 

**Thoughts** JavaScript (which I will be referring to as JS) isn't as difficult as I thought it was going to be. I'm actually learning a lot about HTML and CSS along the way! :)
